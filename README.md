# ABL (Array Based Language) v0.8

As of now (August 2023), ABL has been left unchanged since its last modification in 2021!
I am unsure of when I will be able to return to this project. For now, it works adequately; I expect
to change the overall structure of the language and optimize the code since it's a lot of boilerplate.
